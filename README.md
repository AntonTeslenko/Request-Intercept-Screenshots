 Request Interception Example  

This repository demonstrates how to intercept and modify server responses using **Charles Proxy** to simulate different UI behaviors. 
The example focuses on working with **next.privat24** and intercepting the **"Archive"** request.  

 Steps  
1. Identify the **"Archive"** request in Developer Tools.  
2. Locate it in **Charles Proxy**.  
3. Set a breakpoint and intercept the request.  
4. Modify the response before it reaches the UI.  
5. Observe changes in the front-end.  

 Tools Used  
- **Charles Proxy** – For request interception and modification.  
- **Developer Tools** – To analyze network requests.  

 Purpose  
This method helps test different data scenarios, debug API responses, and verify front-end behavior without backend changes.
